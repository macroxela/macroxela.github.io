Two teammates and I designed an autonomous quadcopter for package pick up & delivery for our senior design project. The packages 
were detected using infrared tags a Wiimote camera attached to the underside of the quadcopter. Each infrared tag blinked a certain 
code identifying it in the order it would be picked up. The infrared detection system was developed by one of my teammates and I in
a previous course.  My responsibility was to design the stability & control system of the quadcopter. This involved designing a PID
controller and a Kalman filter. Despite the effort, we were not able to acquire the necessary values for fine-tuning the PID controller
so we had to resort to trial and error.
