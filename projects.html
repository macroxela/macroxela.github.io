I've worked on various projects during school and during my spare time. Most of the physical projects 
I worked on were part of school assignments. The coding projects tended to be ones I began on my own
or greatly expanded from an original assignment in a course. My coding experience includes C++, Java, MATLAB,
XHTML, SQL, JQuery, PHP, and OpenGL.
</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11234996">Djikstra's Algorithm C++</a></p>
<li>
A basic implementation of Djikstra's algorithm in C++ using a heap. The code reads in from a text file 
the starting and ending coordinates, then reads the matrix of numbers and finds the shortest path between
both points.</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11233925">Interactive Data Structures</a></p>
<li>
An OpenGL application that crates visual representations of linked lists, binary trees, min heaps and max
heaps while allowing the user to interact with them in real time.
</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11238852">Particle Swarm Optimization Visualization</a></p>
<li>
An OpenGL application that allows the viewer to visualize the effect of various parameters on the particle 
swarm optimization algorithm through visual representations.</li><br><br>
  
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/701ab9b7a8e62260ac5e">Javascript Code Editor</a></p>
<li>
A website built with XHTML, PHP, Javascript, and SQL.  It provides several Javascript problems the user 
can answer by writing actual code on the webpage and running it with test values. The user can keep track 
of which questions were answered through a login.

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11238852">Particle Swarm Optimization</a></p>
<li>
An OpenGL application that allows the viewer to visualize the effect of various parameters on the particle
swarm optimization algorithm through visual representations
</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11237566">A* Algorithm Implementation</a></p>
<li>
An implementation of the A* algorithm in C++ using a linked list. The map data (from Lord of the Rings) 
is stored in a separate file which is read in by the main program.
</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/301ae7d9b3dad68095e7">Matrix Header File</a></p>
<li>
A C++ matrix header file for matrix manipulation.
</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11273113">Pokemon Battle</a></p>
<li>
A simple turn based Java game with a Pokemon theme. The user selects which type to start off with and battles
their way through. The player's Pokemon can level up, evolve and learn new moves.
</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11273357">Dungeon Game</a></p>
<li>
Final project for Object Oriented course, basically a mini version of a Zelda dungeon. Includes various enemies,
mid level boss and final boss. Rooms have to be accessed sequentially to unlock them.
</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11234525">NQueen Board Solver</a></p>
<li>
A C++ program that solves the generic N-Queen problem using a genetic algorithm. The queen positions are denoted
by vectors in which the position counter denotes the row and the value in that position denotes the column.
</li><br><br>

<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/11237839">Student Hash Table & AVL Tree</a></p>
<li>
Student data was stored using two different implementations, a hash table and an AVL tree, in C++. The student 
info is hard coded in the file.
</li><br><br>
  
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/macroxela/5bcce2fc0af09d0dd3ffbf987d0e25b6">String Parser C++</a></p>
<li>
A string parser that seperates the first word and the rest of the string.
</li><br><br>
  

<p><a href="senior">QUAD-S</a></p>
<li>
Senior design project for electrical engineering majors. The objective was to build an autonomous quadcopter 
capable of detecting packages and delivering them to the appropriate destinations. Developed in a group of 3.
</li><br><br>
  
<p><a href="PowerPlantDesign.pdf">Power Plant Design</a></p>
<li>Given a basic schematic, we improved the overall efficiency of the power plant by modifying certain 
pressures and temperatures throughout the plant.  We then modified the design to include an additional reheat 
process which even though it reduced the efficiency the plant produced much more power and a better profit overall.  
This was done in a team of two.
