<p class="oswald">
Currently a graduate student at the University of Texas-Rio Grande Valley (formerly UTPA) pursuing a 
master's degree in Computer Science and a mathematics teacher at PSJA Southwest High School. I've taught
all high school grade levels (9 to 12) including Algebra, Geometry, and Algebra II in addition to being
a University Interscholastic League (UIL) coach.   
I obtained a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from UTPA in Spring 2013.  Shortly afterwards 
I began working as a high school math teacher.  I like working on hands-on projects and coding which is 
what made me decide to go for an engineering major.  At some point in the future I will go for a PhD in 
Computer Science with specialization in algorithms and AI.
</p>

<p class="oswald">
I've always pushed myself to do my best at whatever I do.  This combined with my enjoyment of taking 
on challenges helped me graduate early from high school and my undergraduate degree, each one finished 
in 3 years.  Apart from sheer curiosity, the reason I decided to take so many engineering courses in 
various fields is because I personally feel that to be a good engineer one has to be able to tackle any 
problem given to them regardless of the engineering field. Additionally, understanding various concepts 
allows one to view problems in different directions, possibly leading to an unique solution.
</p>

<p class="oswald">
I plan on eventually working as a professor or a head researcher at some research institution or company.  
My main research interests are computational models (in particular quantum computing and models based on 
biology), applications of control theory, and AI applications for robotics.  I am also interested in 
promoting science and engineering to the general public.  Many people lack a good understanding of what 
science, math, and engineering are about.  Scientific literacy is quite low and that can turn out to be 
quite detrimental for scientific and technological progress. Because of this I want to educate the general
public about the important concepts of science and math, hence one of my personal projects which is to 
catalog as much information as possible about topics in science and math and making it accessible to the 
general public.
