This is my personal website, coded in HTML5. Feel free to borrow the code and use it as a template for your own website. It features a moving navigation bar and an interactive map on the travel page created through [Google My Maps](google.com/maps/d). It's simplistic, relying solely on HTML, CSS and Javascript while using the [Google Fonts API](https://fonts.google.com/) for clean text. Based on two W3Schoool templates shown [here](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_start_page.htm) and [here](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryw3css_templates_cv.htm).
