<h1>Roadtrip to Washingon DC</h1>
<h3>22 April 2018</h3>

Haven't posted in a long time due to being quite busy at work. Regardless, I'll cover what I did in Spring Break from March 12 to 18.
So during Spring Break I decided to take a roadtrip to Washington DC. I've travelled to various places around the world but hardly anywhere in the
U.S. Only twice have I ventured out of Texas, when I ran the Las Vegas Marathon and when I camped in the Grand Canyon (I don't really count
my stay at the L.A. airport since I never left it). I've explored more places in Japan than in Texas, let alone the U.S. That being the case,
I decided to take a roadtrip to Washington DC. With a friend of mine, we took off Friday night and arrived Sunday night passing through
Lousiana, Mississipi, Georgia, Tennessee, and Virginia. We stopped occasionally for gas, food, and a few sights on the Mississipi river and
Virginia. Hunkering down for Sunday night in Washington DC we opted to decide which museums to go to in the morning. Despite being Spring, the
temperature was just above freezing. Fortunately we packed some jackets to deal with the cold.
<br><br>
One thing we realized when we arrived is the sheer amount of museums in D.C. Just the Smithsonian consists of around a dozen museums, each one
containing about a day's worth of exhibits to explore. Just outside the National Mall there are various other museums such as the Newseum,
Holocaust Memorial Museum and various others. Some require entry fees (typically around $24) or at least tickets, particularly during Spring
Break due to the large crowds attending. However, they are well worth the wait. Monday morning we picked the National Air and Space Museum during
the morning leaving the National Museum of Natural Sciences for the afternoon. Of course the museum was packed with school children scrambling
around in awe of the grand ships. We weren't much different from them. From the Hidenberg to replicas of Voyager, we kept ourselves busy for at
least 3 hours if not more. We then headed out to the National Museum of Natural Sciences.

Once again we spent countless hours meandering about the halls. Right at the entrance an African elephant greeted us surrounded by multiple halls
of exhibits ranging from animals throughout the world, human evolution, sea life, and minerals. We didn't even have enough time to explore all of
them. I wound up having 10 minutes to explore the minerals exhibit which I only viewed about half. I still enjoyed my time there though.
One of my favorite ones was the human evolution exhibit. They had a wide range of fossils and replicas of all the known human species. One section
contained model heads of the various species at their average height to give you an idea of how tall they were. The exhibit wasn't just about the
human fossil record though. It was about what makes us human, what disntiguishes us from all other living creatures. This aspect fascinates me in
addition to how many different human species existed before. The sheer diversity of human species makes good food for thought.

The following day we woke up earlier to check out the Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument. Although it was much sunnier than Monday, it
turned out to be much windier. Bracing ourselves, we headed to the Lincoln Memorial before the crowds arrived. The size of the marble platform
reminded me of the one at Pyongyang where the leader's statues stand. I much preferred the sights of Washington DC though. As we walked towards
the Washington Monument we stumbled across the World War II Memorial. Pillars represented each state and territory of the U.S. during WW2 while
a dried up pool stood in the center. When we arrived to the Washington Monument we found out it was closed due to repairs on the elevator. It
probably had to do with Spiderman rescuing his classmates from the falling elevator.

After visiting the memorials we toured the National Museum of American History. This museum seemed larger than the previous two since it had 3
floors of exhibits instead of 2. Not only did the exhibits include the expected American history but also showcased pop culture and other cultural
items such as TV shows (the muppets, Bill Nye), kitchens throughout the decades, the rise of tech startups, the first ladies, and American money
throughout the ages.  With little time left, we headed to the National Museum of the American Indian. It turned out to be much smaller than the
other museums but still had interesting displays. An entire section devoted itself to the Inca empire, bringing back memories of my travels in
Peru. One of the more interesting exhibits was about treaties between Native Americans and foreign powers starting from colonization up to modern
times. Although Native Americans tended to get the short end of the deals, many of them never gave up on their requests. Among those treaties was
one between natives in Alaska and state authorities on fishing permits. Even though many locals and companies wanted the state to be completely in
charge of fishing permits the natives fought back in the courts to keep their ancestral rights. Fortunately for them they managed to keep them. In
another case one of the tribes insisted on receiving payments of cloth instead of money, despite repeated request from the U.S. goverment for the
latter. <br>

On Wednesday we arrived early to Ford's Theatre to buy tickets. We originally planned on attending the first tour group and checking out the
National Archives afterwards but as it turned out it was fully booked. Instead we bought tickets for the second group at 9:30. It was a short
experience, not taking longer than an hour checking out the exhibits. From there we passed by the National Archives to check out how long the line
was. It was extremely long, so we skipped it and headed towards the White House. Even though we were denied entry due to the number of people going
in, we still got to walk around this iconic building. Since the National Holocaust museum was close by we headed out to it. We realized by the time
we arrived tickets for the day had run out so we would only be able to explore the special exhibit instead of the permanent one. Still a good experience
since the exhibit showcased replicas of a kid's experiences recovered from his journal and letters. It walked us from his home when he was living quite
happily to the streets when people began singling his family out due to being Jewish to the concentration camp he wound up in. I spent some time
afterwards reflecting on his experiences. Afterwards we toured the Marthin Luther King Memorial, Franklin D. Roosevelt Memorial, and Jefferson Memorial.
The FDR memorial turned out to be quite intersting. Instead of being grand like the other ones, it consisted of several statues of FDR, his pet dog,
Eleanor Roosevelt, and the people who were affected during the Great Depression. The walls contained various quotes from FDR and his wife which one could
see as they walk around. Wednesday was much more about touring the outside attractions than exploring museums.

Thursday was the big day. The day we got to explore the U.S. Capitol building. Fortunately for us, we did get accepted into the tour group which began
at 9 in the morning. Our guide was an intern from college working for Representative John Cornyn. We met up at the office buildings in front of the
Capitol from which we were escorted underground through a labyrinth of hallways. We took a short subway ride to arrive beneath the Capitol. From the
visitor's center there was a small showcase of how the Capitol looked like through the years. From there we toured various rooms such as the old
Supreme Court, the old Congressional Chamber, and a lobby filled with paintings including a panoramic one wrapping around the entire dome depicting
various events in U.S. history. The tour wasn't as intersting as the tour of the Texas Capitol but perhaps it's due to everything being larger in Texas.
A short walk later we wound up at the Library of Congress. For some reason it seemed much smaller than I expected. We weren't able to go into the actual
library but we did walk around the exhibits most of them about colonial and pre-colonial history. The most interesting one was Jefferson's personal
library which still contained various original books.<br><br>

This was our last day in DC and we wanted to make the most of it. Since we had time for one more museum we opted for the Newseum. One of the more interesting
museums, it covers how the press evolved from its origins in the printing press to modern times. Among the exhibits were the 1st amendment, newspapers around
the globe, news from dangerous areas and fallen reporters, the evolution of broadcast media, and 9/11. I liked how similar the Newseum is to the Miraikan
Museum in Tokyo. Yes, it does provide a lot of info but more than that it piques your interest by posing questions on the situations or objects being showcased.
What was your experience of 9/11? How would you get info in a state in which the medai isn't free? Do some amendments trump others? Among the exhibits was one
that showed how free the press is in each country and why it is considered so. Yet other exhibits allowed you to pose as reporters in various situations. This
was definitely one of the more fun museums. Alas, Friday came and so our tour of DC ended. However, before heading back we decided to explore one more museum
a short drive away: The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, an extension of the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum which houses dozens of aircrafts from models of the
first airplanes to spacecraft and modern military planes. Although we arrived quite early so we could also take off early we wound up spending nearly the whole
day in there.
