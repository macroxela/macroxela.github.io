<p>This was the location I selected as my first location to travel abroad. I wasn't even aware one could travel
to the DPRK until a few months before my trip. Why the DPRK as my first location abroad? One, curiosity. It simply
appealed to me how different the DPRK would be from any other country. Two, it would push me past my comfort zone
in a way few other countries can.</p>
Below is my playlist of videos I recorded in the DPRK. The last 5 include a 'documentary' about our trip recorded
by a local guide and a video series by a fellow traveller, Sarhaniy, who was on the same trip.</p>
